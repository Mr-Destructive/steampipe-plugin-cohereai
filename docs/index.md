# CohereAI + Steampipe

[CohereAI](https://cohere.com) is an Artificial Intelligence research and development company that provides APIs for general models.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

Get generations for a given text prompt in your CohereAI account:

```sql
select
  generation 
from
  cohereai_generation 
where
  prompt = 'Write an novel title for a magical world.';
```

```

| Item        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Credentials | CohereAI requires an [API Key](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/api-keys) for all requests.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Permissions | API Keys have the same permissions as the user who creates them, and if the user permissions change, the API key permissions also change.                                                                                                                                               |
| Radius      | Each connection represents a single CohereAI Installation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Resolution  | 1. Credentials explicitly set in a steampipe config file (`~/.steampipe/config/cohereai.spc`)<br />2. Credentials specified in environment variables, e.g., `COHEREAI_API_KEY`. |

### Configuration

Installing the latest comereai plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/cohereai.spc`) with a single connection named `cohereai`:

```hcl
connection "cohereai" {
  plugin = "mr-destructive/cohereai"

  # API key for requests. Required.
  # Get your API key at https://dashboard.cohere.ai/api-keys
  # This can also be set via the `COHEREAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
  # api_key = "asLGEMKWMfkeFKENW038493fnWeng"
}
```

### Credentials from Environment Variables

The CohereAI plugin will use the standard CohereAI environment variables to obtain credentials **only if other arguments (`api_key`) are not specified** in the connection:

```sh
export COHEREAI_API_KEY=asLGEMKWMfkeFKENW038493fnWeng
```
