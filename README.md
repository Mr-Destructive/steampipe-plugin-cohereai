```

Configure your API key in `~/.steampipe/config/cohereai.spc`:

```hcl
connection "cohereai" {
  plugin = "cohereai"

  # API key for requests. Required.
  # Get your API key at https://dashboard.cohere.ai/api-keys
  # This can also be set via the `COHEREAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
  api_key = "asLGEMKWMfkeFKENW038493fnWeng"
}
```

Or through environment variables:

```
export COHEREAI_API_KEY=asLGEMKWMfkeFKENW038493fnWeng
```

Run steampipe:

```shell
steampipe query
```

Run a query:

```sql
select
  generation
from
  cohereai_generation
where
  prompt = '';
```
